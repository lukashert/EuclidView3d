# ConformalGeometricAlgebra

This repository contains two implementations of CGA in java. One is based on code generated by [Ganja.js](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js) and a second is based on the geometric algebra [reference implementation](https://geometricalgebra.org/reference_impl.html) of the book Dorst2007.

It implements code to decompose multivectors into geometric 3d parameters like attitude, radius etc.

The code is in very early experimetal status.
