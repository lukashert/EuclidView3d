# ConformalGeometricAlgebra

The conformal group is the group of transformations that preserve angles. These include the rigid (euclidean) transformations. The conformal group on R^3 has a natural representation in terms of rotations in a 5-D space, with signature R^{4, 1} which means 4 basis vectors have a positive square, and 1 have a negative square. So, in the same way that projective transformations are linearised by working in a 4-D homogeneous space, conformal transformations are linearised in a 5-D space.

This repository contains two implementations of CGA in java. One is based on code generated by [Ganja.js](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js) and a second is based on the geometric algebra [reference implementation](https://geometricalgebra.org/reference_impl.html) of the [book Dorst2007](https://geometricalgebra.org/index.html). It is planed also to add an implementation based on the [JClifford](http://jvclifford.sourceforge.net/) project.

This repository includes code to decompose multivectors into geometric 3d parameters like location, attitude, radius/size/squaredSize, weight etc. and specialized classes to represent Vectors, Bivectors, Trivectors etc.

The code is in very early experimetal status.
