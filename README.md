# ConformalGeometricAlgebra

This repository contains two implementations of CGA. One is based on code generated by [Ganja.js](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js) and a second is based on the geometric algebra reference implementation of the book Dorst2007.

The code is in very early experimetal status.
